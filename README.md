# Maji_Ndogo_Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing water resource data from Maji Ndogo to address critical issues like water quality, accessibility, and pollution. Using SQL, I explored over 60,000 records to derive actionable insights and support data-driven decision-making.
#Tools Used
-SQL: For querying, data cleaning, and transformation.

-Data Visualization Tools: PowerBI

#Key Objectives

-Understand water source distribution and quality.

I-dentify pollution trends and high-risk areas.

-Analyze visitation patterns to water sources.

#Approach

-Data Exploration: Used SELECT queries to familiarize myself with the dataset.

-nvestigated relationships between tables using joins and keys.

#Data Cleaning: Fixed inconsistencies in employee and location data.

-Updated email formats and trimmed unnecessary characters in phone numbers.

#Data Analysis: Clustered water source data to identify usage patterns.

-Highlighted areas with frequent pollution issues.

#Reporting:

-Aggregated insights into summaries for better understanding and decision-making.

#Results
-Flagged polluted water sources and prioritized areas for intervention.

-Uncovered usage patterns to guide resource distribution.

-Provided actionable insights for policy-making and community support.

#Insights

This project demonstrated how structured data analysis can drive impactful solutions. By clustering and analyzing water quality data, we can better allocate resources and prioritize interventions.
