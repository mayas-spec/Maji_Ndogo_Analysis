# Maji Ndogo Analysis 🌊  
**Unveiling Insights from Water Resource Data**  

This project explores critical water resource challenges in **Maji Ndogo**, focusing on water quality, accessibility, and pollution. By analyzing over 60,000 records using **SQL** and creating compelling visuals in **Power BI**, I derived actionable insights to support data-driven decision-making and governance.

## 🔧 Tools Used  
- **SQL**: Querying, data cleaning, and transformation.  
- **Power BI**: Interactive data visualization and storytelling.  

---

## 🎯 Key Objectives  
1. Understand water source distribution and quality.  
2. Identify pollution trends and high-risk areas.  
3. Analyze visitation patterns to water sources.

## 🛠️ Approach  

### 1. **Data Exploration**  
- Wrote SQL `SELECT` queries to understand the structure and key metrics of the dataset.  
- Investigated relationships between tables using joins and keys to create a cohesive view of the data.  

### 2. **Data Cleaning**  
- Resolved inconsistencies in employee and location datasets.  
- Standardized email formats and removed unnecessary characters from phone numbers for a cleaner dataset.  

### 3. **Data Analysis**  
- Clustered water source data to identify trends and usage patterns.  
- Highlighted areas frequently affected by pollution to aid targeted interventions.  

### 4. **Data Visualization**  
- Created interactive Power BI dashboards to visualize insights, enabling stakeholders to drill down into critical metrics like:  
  - Rural vs. Urban water access distribution.  
  - Peak usage times and gender dynamics in water collection.  
  - Areas requiring urgent infrastructure upgrades.  

---

## 🌟 Key Insights  
- Rural areas show significantly lower access to clean water compared to urban centers.  
- Pollution hotspots are concentrated in specific regions, requiring immediate attention.  
- Queues for water collection peak in the mornings and evenings, with weekends seeing the longest wait times.
